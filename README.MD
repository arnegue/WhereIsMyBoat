Ever wondered where your boat is? With this handy program, you can track your boat's current location and display it right on the touch screen of your ESP32!

**Features**

* **Live AIS Tracking**: Retrieves your boat's AIS (Automatic Identification System) position from [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io/) (via WebSocketSecure).
* **Dynamic Mapping**: Fetches map tiles from  [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) for your boatâ€™s location, converting PNGs using the efficient [Pngle](https://github.com/kikuchan/pngle) library
* **Interactive Display**: Displays the map on a  [4.3" TouchScreen](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-lcd-4.3.htm) or [this one](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-lcd-4.3b.htm) powered by the versatile [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) graphics library.

This program combines real-time tracking and intuitive visuals to keep your boat's location just a glance away. Perfect for tech-savvy mariners!

# TODOs

* Downloading
    * add a http buffer to each tile, to download and convert tiles in parallel
    * If new tiles get downloaded because of new position but inbetween the zoom changes, tiles may will get downloaded simultaneously
        * Use callbacks (mutex!) for zoom changes and new ais position (-> new thread?)
* Wifi
    * WiFi reconnection
    * Connecting to Android AP not working?
    * Put WiFi-state in screen (also in initial connect)
* Put setup error in a label
* Maybe put a frame around tiles to only download 2*3 instead of 2*4 tile
